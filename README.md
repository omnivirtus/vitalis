# Vitalis

> *A death-driven, mathematically elegant, vi-native roguelike where every death makes the experience truly vital.*

## The Vision

**Vitalis** is an ambitious CLI roguelike that reimagines how stories, mathematics, and player agency intersect in game design. Built for the terminal, designed for vi users, and crafted in Rust.

### The Difference

**Death-Driven Narrative**: Unlike traditional roguelikes with quick runs, Vitalis creates 10-120 hour emotional journeys where death is meaningful, not punitive.

**The Tapestry System**: Every element—NPCs, items, regions, weather, stories—follows the same mathematical laws, creating unprecedented emergent complexity.

**Vi-Native Interface**: Full vi modal editing experience with hjkl movement, marks, and muscle memory integration.

**Multi-Generational Progression**: Your characters die, but their impact on the world persists across generations.

**Mathematical Elegance**: Simple Thread interaction rules generate infinite narrative possibilities.

### The Design

Vitalis is built on **The Tapestry** metaphor, where:

- **Threads** are all game elements (players, NPCs, items, regions)
- **The Weaver** enforces mathematical laws governing Thread interactions  
- **Patterns** provide the vi-native player interface
- **Story Weavers** actively create living narratives
- **The Seamstress** preserves everything across time and death
- **The Great Loom** coordinates all systems

## The Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

Vitalis is currently in early development. We're building the foundational architecture that will enable this vision:

- ✅ Complete game design document
- ✅ Unified domain language and architecture
- ✅ Development guidelines and practices
- 🔄 Component tests and core implementation (in progress)
- ⏳ The Great Loom bootstrap system
- ⏳ Thread property system
- ⏳ Vi command interface
- ⏳ Basic world generation

## The Philosophy

> *"When everything shares the same mathematical foundation, complex interactions emerge naturally."*

Vitalis proves that **mathematical consistency**, not content volume, is the key to creating truly dynamic, emotionally engaging roguelike experiences. Every system operates through the same elegant rules, ensuring that player actions ripple through the world in predictable yet surprising ways.

## For Developers

This project follows strict **Test-Driven Development** with **Domain-Driven Design** principles. Every feature emerges from failing tests, and our architecture maintains clean boundaries between domains.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for complete development guidelines and [`docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`](docs/GAME_DESIGN.md) for the full vision.

## For Players

Vitalis will challenge everything you expect from roguelikes.

**Narratively Rich Progression**: Players advance through meaningful experiences and achievements, not mindless repetition.

**Story-Driven Pacing**: Stories unfold at the pace they deserve, without artificial time pressure.

**Meaningful Legacy**: Every character matters to the world's history, with no throwaway runs.

**Emergent Depth**: Elegant mathematical rules create infinite complexity from simple interactions.

## The Etymology

**Vitalis** (Latin: "vital, life-giving") captures the beautiful irony of a death-driven game where meaningful death creates truly vital gameplay experiences. The "vi" prefix also honors the editor that inspired our interface philosophy.
