//! The Seamstress - Persistence across generations
//!
//! This bounded context handles saving and loading game state,
//! preserving the weaving across character deaths and play sessions.
//!
//! For the initial MVP, this is stubbed - we'll focus on in-memory state first.

// Future: Save/load implementation using serde
// Future: Cross-generational memory preservation
