# LLM Context & Project Management Document

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM

**You are working on a Rust CLI roguelike game called "Vibe". This document contains all context needed to resume work on this project at any time.**

### Essential Context
- **User Profile**: Experienced with TDD but new to Rust and game development
- **Development Approach**: Test-driven development throughout
- **Architecture Goal**: Clean, domain-driven design with platform abstractions
- **Current Phase**: Documentation and initial setup

### Key Documents
1. **GAME_DESIGN.md** - The authoritative specification (human & LLM readable)
2. **LLM_CONTEXT.md** - This document (LLM-focused tracking)

### Your Responsibilities
1. **Always read GAME_DESIGN.md first** when resuming work
2. **Update both documents** as the project evolves
3. **Maintain the TODO tracking** in this document
4. **Follow TDD principles** religiously
5. **Ask clarifying questions** about Rust concepts when needed

## PROJECT STATE

### Outstanding Design Areas to Explore (Optional)
- [ ] **Economy System** (merchant networks, supply/demand, pricing)
- [ ] **Magic System** (spell schools, mana mechanics, magical research)  
- [ ] **Faction & Politics System** (guild relationships, territory control)
- [ ] **Crafting & Item Creation** (recipes, quality levels, experimentation)
- [ ] **Weather & Environmental Systems** (seasons, natural disasters, climate effects)
- [ ] **Transportation & Travel** (mounts, vehicles, fast travel, logistics)
- [ ] **Character Advancement Beyond Stats** (titles, achievements, unlockables)
- [ ] **Endgame Content** (what happens after reaching godlike power?)
- [ ] **Multiplayer Considerations** (how systems would extend to shared world)
- [ ] **Modding & Extension Framework** (how players could add content)

### Current Understanding: Systems Integration
The revolutionary aspect of this design is how ALL systems use the same mathematical foundations:
- **Universal 10-Stat System** (0-20 scale) applies to everything
- **Universal Contest Resolution** (50% baseline + stat differences)
- **Universal State System** (Temporary/Permanent/Toggleable states modify all entities)
- **Mathematical Story Generation** (narratives emerge from statistical interactions)
- **Infinite Composability** (simple rules â†’ infinite unique experiences)

### Current Sprint
**Goal**: Project foundation and basic structure
- [ ] Cargo.toml with dependencies
- [ ] Nix flake configuration
- [ ] Project directory structure
- [ ] Platform abstraction traits
- [ ] Basic entity structs

### Backlog (Priority Order)
1. **Terminal I/O Implementation**
   - crossterm integration
   - basic display and input handling
   - color support

2. **Core Game Loop**
   - main game state
   - turn-based mechanics
   - input â†’ action â†’ update â†’ render cycle

3. **Character System**
   - player classes (start with just Rogue)
   - basic stats system
   - character creation UI

4. **Map & Movement**
   - simple grid-based maps
   - player movement
   - collision detection

5. **Basic Combat**
   - single monster type
   - turn-based combat mechanics
   - simple damage calculation

### Future Phases
- Equipment system
- NPC interactions
- Procedural generation
- Story system
- Polish and optimization

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS LOG

### Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Rust (user requirement)
- **Display**: Terminal with crossterm crate
- **Testing**: Standard Rust testing + proptest for property-based tests
- **Build**: Nix flakes for reproducible builds
- **Structure**: Layered architecture with platform abstractions

### Dependencies Chosen
```toml
[dependencies]
crossterm = "0.27"      # Terminal manipulation
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }  # Serialization
rand = "0.8"            # Random generation
clap = { version = "4.0", features = ["derive"] }   # CLI parsing

[dev-dependencies]
proptest = "1.0"        # Property-based testing
```

### Key Patterns
- **Entity-Component thinking** but simplified for single-player
- **Command pattern** for all player actions
- **Strategy pattern** for different player classes
- **Abstract Factory** for procedural generation

## TESTING STRATEGY DETAILS

### Test Pyramid
```
    /\
   /  \    E2E Tests (few, critical paths)
  /____\   
 /      \   Integration Tests (moderate, system interactions)
/__________\ Unit Tests (many, individual components)
```

### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Character Creation Flow**
   - Select class â†’ validate stats â†’ confirm â†’ enter world

2. **Basic Movement**
   - Input key â†’ validate move â†’ update position â†’ redraw

3. **Simple Combat**
   - Encounter monster â†’ enter combat mode â†’ attack/defend â†’ resolution

4. **Equipment Interaction**
   - Find item â†’ pick up â†’ equip â†’ stat changes â†’ combat effects

### Mock Strategy
- **Input/Output**: Mock for deterministic testing
- **Random Generation**: Seeded for reproducible tests
- **Time/Turn System**: Controlled for predictable behavior

## RUST LEARNING NOTES

### Concepts to Explore
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Critical for game state management
- **Traits**: For platform abstractions and entity behaviors
- **Enums**: Perfect for player classes and game states
- **Error Handling**: Result types for save/load and I/O
- **Modules**: Clean code organization

### Patterns to Use
- **Builder Pattern**: For complex entity creation
- **State Machine**: For game states and AI behaviors
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling
- **Command Pattern**: For player actions and AI

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-engineering early (start simple!)
- Fighting the borrow checker (design with ownership in mind)
- Premature optimization (correctness first)
- Large monolithic functions (keep small and focused)

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Standard Process
1. **Read current state** in this document
2. **Check GAME_DESIGN.md** for specification details
3. **Write tests first** for new functionality
4. **Implement minimum code** to pass tests
5. **Refactor** for clean design
6. **Update both documents** with progress and decisions

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass and provide good coverage
- [ ] Code follows Rust idioms and conventions
- [ ] Functions are small and single-purpose
- [ ] Names clearly express domain concepts
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation explains "why" not just "what"

### Git Workflow
- Small, focused commits
- Clear commit messages explaining the "why"
- Regular pushes to avoid losing work
- Tags for major milestones
